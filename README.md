## Project Challenge - User Experience based Sales Report

This challenge involved using a already designed report, made in a previous module, and modifying it to focus on user experience. By that, certain topics like Positioning, Contrast, Golden Ratio and Data Segmentation had to be tackled to assure a better understanding of the visuals implemented. These were the results.

The first page was made together with the instructor, mixing various buttons for ease of navigation with a better layout for the visuals, using the Golden Ratio for positioning.

Much like the first page, the second one had the use of bookmarks for dynamic visual changing, along with some changes to the layout and the addition of navigation buttons in the sidebar.

The third and last page had the least modifications, the navigations buttons were added to the left bar and the colors were changed to fit the aesthetic.
